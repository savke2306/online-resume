    <h1>My hobbies:</h1> <hr />
    <p>There are various things that I like doing in my free time. Some of them are indoor activities, but some are outdoor.
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Watching TV</h3></li>
                <p>
                    In my leisure time, I enjoy watching TV. On rainy days, when there's nothing else on my agenda, 
                    I often opt for a movie; however, my preference leans towards TV series. With the abundance of streaming services 
                    available today, there's a wide array of options to explore. Among my top favorites are "Friends," "House MD," 
                    "Everybody Loves Raymond," "Game of Thrones," "Yellowstone," and "Breaking Bad." Without a doubt, "Friends" 
                    holds the title as my all-time favorite TV show!

            <li><h3>Playing basketball</h3></li>
                <p>I love playing basketball with my friends, especially during the summer! It's an excellent form of exercise.</p>
            <li><h3>Reading novels</h3></li>
                <p>I love to read, especailly at night right before I go to sleep. It's a great way to relax my eyes and mind.
                    Fredrick Backman and Jo Nesbo are two of my favorite authors. However, I love the Harry Potter novels, too.
